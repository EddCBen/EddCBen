    Iâ€™m Charaf, independent researcher working mostly on models for sequencial-data, language-related tasks, and cool LLM-based projects.
    I am interested in Deep Learning and building software that makes Training Deep Neural Networks easy to everyone, 
    Low-resource Languages, and AVOIDING fine-tuning of LARGE language models.
